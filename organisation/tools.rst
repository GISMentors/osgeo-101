================
The tools we use
================

Remember: OSGeo started in 2006 and since then, most of the technical tools
remain the same. Some of them were pretty modern back in the days (like Wiki),
some up-to-date (e-mail), some were considered old-time even in those days
(IRC), but we did not find anything better.

OSGeo UserID
-------------

Get your `UserID
<https://www.osgeo.org/community/getting-started-osgeo/osgeo_userid/>`_, you may
use it for various services within OSGeo.

Mailing lists: For daily communication
--------------------------------------

.. figure:: https://www.gnu.org/software/mailman/images/logo2010-2.jpg

        OSGeo uses `GNU Mailman
        <https://www.gnu.org/software/mailman/index.html>`_ for empowering the
        lists infrastructure.

Mailing lists are the heard and soul of OSGeo community communication. 99% of
what is happening in the community, all the organisation happens in asynchronous
mode via mailing list.

**What is an mailing list?**
        `An electronic mailing list or email list
        <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_mailing_list>`_ is a special
        use of email that allows for widespread distribution of information to
        many Internet users. It is similar to a traditional mailing list - a
        list of names and addresses - as might be kept by an org anization for
        sending publications to its members or customers, but typically refers
        to four things:

        * a list of email addresses,
        * the people ("subscribers") receiving mail at those addresses, thus
          defining a community gathered around a topic of interest.
        * the publications (email messages) sent to those addresses, and
        * a reflector, which is a single email address that, when designated as
          the recipient of a message, will send a copy of that message to all of
          the subscribers.

        In short: you send e-mail to one address and it will arrive into mailbox
        of another thousands of people, who subscribed for it.

**Where are relevant mailing list of OSGeo? What the one interesting for me?**

        You go ti https://lists.osgeo.org and see the list. There are at the
        moment (summer 2019) 296 (!) mailing lists. You have to choose one by
        name and description.

Generally speaking, there are several types of e-mail lists within OSGeo:

* Organisational and about OSGeo itself
* Local chapter mailing lists
* Projects mailing list.

**Which mailing lists is worth to follow?**
        This depends on your focus and interest. It's always good to watch your
        project user list (e.g. https://lists.osgeo.org/mailman/listinfo/qgis-user).
        If you are interested in OSGeo itself, you may follow one or two OSGeo
        lists.


Some of the OSGeo mailing lists and their purpose
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

`OSGeo-Discuss <https://lists.osgeo.org/mailman/listinfo/discuss>`_
        This is, where most of the day-to-day communication within OSGeo takes
        place. If you are looking for some hint or need to talk to most of the
        people within OSGeo, this is the place to go.

        `Archive <https://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/discuss/>`_  Expect traffic
        about n*10^1 emails per week.

`OSGeo-Board <https://lists.osgeo.org/mailman/listinfo/board>`_
        This is the place, where all the communication within the Board's topics
        is taking place. If you want to watch Board in action, go there.

`FOSS4G Conference-dev <https://lists.osgeo.org/mailman/listinfo/conference_dev>`_
        Everything new about conference organisation. Each FOSS4G has it's own
        mailing lists (e.g. `FOSS4G 2019 <https://lists.osgeo.org/mailman/listinfo/foss4g2019>`_)

How to subscribe to mailing list
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
1. Pick the topic you would like to join (e.g.  `OSGeo-Discuss <https://lists.osgeo.org/mailman/listinfo/discuss>`_), 
2. Fill the details in the registration form
3. Confirm link in the confirmation e-mail
4. Set filters in your mail box!
5. Consider fine-tuning your "out-of-office" automatic response

**May I greet everybody, once IÍ„'m in?**
        No. Write only, if you have something real to say. It's ok to introduce
        yourself if you did not do it so far, but stick to the topic and try to
        keep to traffic as low as possible.

How to send e-mail to mailing list
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Once you are registered, you can write e-mail to specific address, e.g. discuss@lists.osgeo.org - it will be received by everybody else.

How to unregister
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
In the same form, you registered


The Wiki: Archive and documentation
-----------------------------------

https://wiki.osgeo.org


.. figure:: https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/64/MediaWiki_logo_without_tagline.png

        OSGeo uses `MediaWiki <https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki>`_

Wiki is the archive and way how to create documents collaboratively. There is
track of all the documents, users, day-to-day records for the committees and
ad-hoc teams. 

Of course, it's a Wiki, that means, that there is a lot of informations, some of
them up-to-date, some of them not so up-to date.

Everybody can create new page any time, but search twice and things at least
twice, before you start a new page - maybe there is already just existing
something similar, which you can pick and start to work at.

IRC: oneline chat
-----------------

For online chat as well as for  committee meetings, we use `IRC (Internet Relay Chat) <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat>`_ - protocol, which was created in 1988(!). Even it's possible to install IRC server on your own hardware,
OSGeo uses service provided by the `Freenode <https://freenode.net/>`_ server.

All you have to do, is to go to the `webchat https://webchat.freenode.net/ <https://webchat.freenode.net/>`_, pick you nick name and know the chatroom you want to join. There are permanent chatrooms as well as
temporary for ad-hoc meetings.

Within OSGeo, several permanent rooms are available, namely

* #osgeo 
* #grass 
* #qgis 
* #gdal 
* ...

You can find more at `OSGeo IRC Wiki <https://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/IRC>`_

Software for IRC protocol
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The easiest option is the Web interface. Most of the old-school chat programs,
like Pidgin and others do have support for IRC.

Trac: original ticketing system
-------------------------------

`Trac <https://trac.osgeo.org/>`_ was one of the first ticketing and source-code
managing systems used within OSGeo. It's still used by some projects and also
for some of the internal agendas (like the SAC team).

.. note:: You man need the OSGeo ID for being able to add new tickets to Trac.

Gitea: new ticketing system
---------------------------

New times bring new services, and so GIT arrived to OSGeo. `OSGeo Gitea instance
<https://git.osgeo.org/gitea>`_ is the preferred way, how to keep track of
projects. It is also one of the  services, OSGeo offers to new projects (if you
are unhappy with one of the commercial services for your source code).


.. note:: You man need the OSGeo ID for being able to add new tickets to Gitea.
