Local Chapters
==============

`Local Chapters <https://www.osgeo.org/local-chapters/>`_ are the place you can
connect with other OSGeo members in your country, region or language.

There are over 60 local chapters registered `in the wiki <https://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/Local_Chapters>`_

Howto start local chapter
-------------------------

0. Review Local `Chapter Guidelines <https://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/Local_Chapter_Guidelines>`_ to make sure you understand what a Local
   Chapter does and should look like.
1. Start a wiki page for this local chapter.  Link it from the local chapters page: http://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/Local_Chapters 
2. Join the OSGeo main `Discuss <https://lists.osgeo.org/mailman/listinfo/discuss>`_ mailing list and introduce the idea there.
3. Once you get a critical mass of people or need a better forum for regional discussion, we should create a mailing list for you.
4. Official OSGeo Local Chapter is recognized by the Board

*Does Local Chapter be official legal entity?*
        No! Just group of people around mailing list and wiki will do. Timew
        will show, whether forming legal body will help for your local
        activities.
