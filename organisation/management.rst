Board organisation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The main resource is `the Wiki
<https://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/Board_of_Directors>`_.

For all the motions, the Board uses the `Loomio service <https://www.loomio.org/g/kdSmIwxu/osgeo-board>`_. Generally the voting period of time is one week.

For actions and issues, the Board uses custom `Issue tracker <https://git.osgeo.org/gitea/osgeo/todo/issues>`_.

For the Board meeting, traditionally we use `IRC <https://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/Board_of_Directors#Board_Meetings>`_. The meeting takes place regularly *last Monday of the month from 16.00 UTC.*

There are also occasional face-to-face meetings, usually organised during
conferences (there is one at this FOSS4G as well).

You can always join the Board meeting. You can always check the voting results.
You can usually participate at the Board's meeting actively (although hight
level of discipline is needed, since the meeting is having it's agenda, people
are spread around the world in different time zones).

And of course, there is the `Board mailing list <https://lists.osgeo.org/mailman/listinfo/board>`_

Focus
        The board's primary responsibility is to efficiently and effectively
        make strategic decisions related to the running of OSGeo.

Payment (lack of)
        Directors are not paid for their service (bylaws section 3.4), but director
        should not be out of pocket when working for the board.

Time Commitment
        Directors should expect to spend 4 to 12 hours per month of their spare time on
        board activities.

Monthly meetings
        Directors should attempt to attend all board meetings, which happen once per
        month, for ~ 1 to 1.5 hours.

Face to face meetings
        OSGeo Directors often attend conferences such as FOSS4G as part of their
        professional or personal interest, and these offer an opportunity for board
        members to meet face-to-face.

Email list
        Directors should monitor and contribute toward discussions on the board email
        list, and aim to vote on motions within 2 working days. There are typically a
        dozen email topics, absorbing ~ 2 hours reading/writing per month.

Advocacy
        Directors should be prepared to represent OSGeo locally, possibly
        internationally, typically by presenting or working an OSGeo booth at
        conferences, in line with our OSGeo Advocate program.
