======================================
What does it mean, to be OSGeo Project
======================================

This means, that an open source geospatial-related project had to go through the
`incubation process <https://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/Incubation_Committee>`_. During
this process, community around the project has to make sure (based on the
`incubation checklist
<https://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/Project_Graduation_Checklist>`_), that the project
meets following criteria:

* Openness 
* Clear and open Copyright and License
* Described and stable decision and other processes 
* Documentation
* Release Procedure
* OSGeo Committees and Community (formed Project steering committee)
* Marketing
* Connection to other projects

Basically it means to clean licenses, formalize processes and form the Steering
Committee.

Longest project in incubation: PyWPS - 9 years

Some never incubate.

*Q: Is OSGeo providing software certification?*
        Kind of. Making sure, that the community is open and stable.

************************
OSGeo Community projects
************************

Maybe your project is too small. Maybe the community is not big enough. But you
still want to affiliate your project to OSGeo.

Then it probably belongs to the `community projects <https://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/OSGeo_Community_Projects>`_

OSGeo Community Projects are software projects that:

* Have an open source license.
* Welcome new contributors.
* Are in the process of building their developer and user communities.
* Are in the process of working on project governance, documentation, and marketing.

One day, your project may approach the full incubation.

* MapProxy
* pgRouting

* Postal Address Geo-Coder
