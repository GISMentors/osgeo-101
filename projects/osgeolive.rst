=========

`OSGeo-Live <https://live.osgeo.org/>`_ is special type of an OSGeo project.

It is a self-contained bootable DVD, USB thumb drive or Virtual Machine
based on Lubuntu, that allows you to try a wide variety of open source
geospatial software without installing anything. It is composed entirely of free
software, allowing it to be freely distributed, duplicated and passed around.

All of the OSGeo projects as well as community projects who were able to prepare
sample installation along with required documentation are included at the
distribution.

You can have complete GIS desktop and server workstation along with the
software, data and documentation. OSGeo-live is always used at the workshops. If
you want to try some software, OSGeo-live is always up-to-date, containing the
fresh meat.
